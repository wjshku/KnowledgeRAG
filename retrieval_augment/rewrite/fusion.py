        # multiple query variations from a single user question, retrieves 
        # documents for each variation, and then fuses the results to provide 
        # more comprehensive and accurate information.
        # - **Better Coverage:** Addresses different ways the same information might be expressed
        # - **Reduced Bias:** Less dependent on specific query phrasing
