One aspect of AdSense was reminiscent of the black box that determined
the ad quality rating of AdWords. When someone clicked on an AdSense ad, the
money paid by the advertiser was split between Google and the publisher whose
site hosted the ad. According to Rajaram, the original thought was to split the
money down the middle—Google would take half and the AdSense publisher
would take the other half. But Brin thought that such a split gave too much to
Google. The idea was to build the program for the long run, and if Google made
it clear that it was taking half the money, a competitor might undercut the
program by giving 80 or even 90 percent of the fee to the publisher. So Google
decided to give the majority of the money to the publisher. Then Susan Wojcicki
came up with an idea that some might find strange: What if we don’t reveal the
revenue share percentage with the publisher? That way Google wouldn’t have to
worry about a competitor boasting a better split.
Gokul Rajaram was startled by the idea. “What?” he said. “How can we not
tell the publishers what percentage of the revenue they get?”
“The publishers shouldn’t care about the revenue share,” Wojcicki told him.
“What they should care about is the bottom line.”
On the face of it, the scheme flew in the face of Google’s stated goal of
transparency. But when Google decided that it was in its interest to keep
something secret—as the “hiding strategy” showed—it reconsidered. The
dichotomy of closed and open at Google might be traced to Larry Page’s
personal library. On one hand there was Don Norman’s book, a polemic urging
total fealty to the user, making everything clear to customers and visitors to a
site. On the other hand, there was Nikola Tesla, exploited and dying alone in a
New York City hotel. With regard to the revenue split in AdSense, Google
wasn’t going to be Tesla. Besides, why would publishers complain if Google
made them more money than the competitors?
“It was one of the single biggest painful things for me,” says Rajaram. “On
every panel I went to for the first year, I would get questions about why isn’t
Google sharing the revenue split and why isn’t Google being transparent. People
said we were doing it because we weren’t generous. But quite to the contrary, we
were being generous. We just didn’t want our competitors to tell publishers that
they were offering a better revenue share.”
(In May 2010, Google finally revealed the split. “In the spirit of greater
transparency,” Google reported that of the money received from advertisers on
AdSense for content, 68 percent went to the publishers whose pages hosted the
ads. Google kept the other 32 percent. That was close to the proportions that
participants and analysts had long assumed. Google’s belated announcement (Source: data/pdf/In The Plex (Google).pdfPage: 115)
can’t easily explain it to advertisers.” On the other hand, he adds, “It actually
turns into a fun mathematical problem, which I loved.”
From the start, Page and Brin had an idealistic view that Google would run
ads only if users deemed them a useful feature. Using mathematical wizardry,
Veach and Kamangar had come up with a mechanism to realize that fantastic
aspiration. Google’s original system asked advertisers to pay a fixed rate to
expose their ads on a results page triggered by targeted keywords. The new
system asked advertisers to participate in an auction that determined how much
they would pay every time someone clicked on the targeted ad. What’s more, by
rewarding better ads the new system made users happier by increasing the odds
that what appeared on the page was relevant to their queries. The system
enforced Google’s insistence that advertising shouldn’t be a transaction between
publisher and advertiser but a three-way relationship that also included the user.
But would it work? For one thing, executing the system was a huge
technological challenge. Every AdWords Select ad would be the winner of a
unique auction requiring the execution of a complicated formula. The auction
would be conducted in stealth, generated the instant someone typed a keyword
into the Google search box, with the result shown in a fraction of a second. “I
don’t know the number of auctions that we run per day, but for purposes of
argument, use a billion or a hundred million,” says Schmidt. “We run many more
auctions than anyone else on the planet because we run them in real time, we run
one auction per ad per page, and that’s multiplied by the numbers of ads per
page. It’s a phenomenal number. Technologically, because of latency, you have
to do this very, very quickly.” Fortunately for Google, even in 2002, when the
new system was completed, the company was fanatically focused on huge
computational feats performed at dizzying speed on a platform of thousands of
computers, so it was able to leap the technology hurdle.
The dicier challenge was getting skeptical customers of the original
AdWords to leave a system they were happy with to try this complicated new
one. On January 24, 2002, Google tested AdWords Select by offering it to
selected advertisers. In order to lure them to the new program, Google stacked
the deck: it placed ads bought under the new AdWords Select system in more
favorable positions than the advertisers had actually paid for. “The old AdWords
customers would say, ‘How do we get to position one?’ And we’d say, ‘Oh, you
sign up to this system over here.’ They were signing up in droves, so it really
simplified our lives,” says Veach. Spurred by the initial returns from higher
positions, advertisers began spending more money in the new system—and
getting clearly better returns. Within a month, Google simply pulled the plug on
the old CPM system and sent all its advertisers an email informing them of the (Source: data/pdf/In The Plex (Google).pdfPage: 102)
advertising—found itself locked into the model that had initially brought it
success. Google innovated circles around Overture, focusing on its core
obsessions of speed and scale. Overture required its advertisers to pick specific
keywords; Google would match an ad to many keywords, some of them with
subtle connections discovered by analysis of the behavior of its millions of users.
Overture concentrated on high-value accounts that it sold by hand. Google built
a self-service system that allowed it to accommodate hundreds of thousands of
advertisers. Overture did implement some of Google’s innovations, such as the
second-price auction. But by then AdWords had left Overture and Yahoo in the
dust.
(Bill Gross would later shrug off the fact that his ideas involving pay per
click and ad auctions had made billionaires at Google but not at Idealab. “I feel
we won,” he says. “There was the satisfaction of breaking the code. We
originally invested $200,000 in GoTo, and when we sold Overture, we made
$200 million. That was a pretty great return. And we learned our lessons about
patent protection.”)
AdWords Select rolled out in February 2002. The AOL deal went into effect
in May. Suddenly, Google’s financial crisis was over. Now Google had a cash
cow that would fund the next decade’s worth of projects, from brilliant to
lunatic. In 2007, writing about the “spectacular commercial success” of the
second-price auction model, economists at Stanford, Harvard, and the University
of California at Berkeley described it as “the dominant transaction mechanism in
a large and rapidly growing industry.”
Before AdWords Select and the AOL deal, Eric Schmidt often passed by
Sheryl Sandberg’s cubicle and asked her how many advertisers Google had.
“Not many,” she would say. Later in the day, he’d ask her the same question.
“Eric,” she’d say, “not many more than we had three hours ago.” In 2002, all that
changed. AdWords Select was drawing new advertisers to the Internet, and the
AOL partnership was pulling in ones that had resisted Google. “So we just
started growing,” says Sandberg. “It went unbelievably well. And nobody knew
just how well until the IPO.” (Source: data/pdf/In The Plex (Google).pdfPage: 108)
created a “black box” in which advertisers could never understand, or trust, the
calculations that Google made to place their ads.
Here was the rub: The bids submitted by contenders for the ad slots were
only half of what ultimately determined the winners of the auction. The other
half was the quality score. This metric would assure that the ads Google showed
on its results page were helpful to its users—a high quality score meant that the
ad was relevant to the user’s quest. Low quality scores were for ads that were
irrelevant, misleading, or even spamlike. In the early version of AdWords, the
sole determinant of the quality score was Google’s guess at the percentage of
times a user would click on an ad when it appeared on a results page—the click-
through rate. Later Google used a more complicated formula to determine
quality score by adding factors such as the relevance of the ad to the specific
keyword and the quality of the landing page. But the biggest factor remained the
predicted click-through rate.
Say that Alice, Juan, and Ted are all bidding for the keyword “hand lotion.”
Alice is selling an artisanal form of hand lotion popular in upscale spas. Juan
owns a big drugstore that sells hand lotion, among many sundries. Ted has a
travel site. He isn’t selling hand lotion at all but wants to expose his ad to the
kind of person who buys hand lotion. Alice bids ten cents per click. Juan bids
fifteen cents. Ted bids fifty cents. If you think that Ted’s high bid automatically
puts him in the top position, you’re wrong. It’s quite possible that Alice, the low
bidder, would get the favored spot. Google’s calculations might determine that
users who click on her site are more likely to find what they want and thus
assign her a very high quality score. Juan’s quality score would be downgraded
—as would his effective bid—because users may go to his site and have
difficulty finding hand lotion. He may be in position two, paying a little less than
Alice. Ted would have an even lower quality score. People looking for hand
lotion are unlikely to click on a travel ad. His bid would be downgraded even
more. (He may even be required to pay a prohibitively high “minimum bid”—a
practice that ultimately engendered a lot of grumbling among certain
advertisers.)
The beauty of the ad quality formula, says Sheryl Sandberg, is that “it made
the advertiser do the work to be relevant. You paid less if your ads were more
relevant. So you had a reason to work on your keyword, your text, your landing
page, and generally improve your campaign.” There were some downsides,
though. Chief among them was that the system was fairly complicated and
risked befuddling an advertiser.
Veach would acknowledge this. “It’s not so much that any of these ideas on
their own are complicated,” he says. “But when you put the three together, you (Source: data/pdf/In The Plex (Google).pdfPage: 101)
the fact that advertisers were bound to pay the amount they had bid, even if the
next lowest bidder had offered significantly less. “That means that advertisers
always have an incentive to lower their bids [in subsequent rounds],” he says.
(This was known in the auction world as “bid shading.”) As an example, he
would cite the case where an advertiser bid 50 cents and the next highest bidder
offered only 40 cents. Clearly the high bidder would be unhappy, because the
optimal bid was 41 cents, and the winner was stuck with paying nine cents too
much. A cottage industry of software vendors had provided programs to
automate bid shading on Overture, so winners would keep submitting slightly
lower bids, and losers would edge up. “I wanted to avoid that cat-and-mouse
game,” says Veach.
So Veach devised a different model: the winner of the auction wouldn’t be
charged for the amount of his victorious bid but instead would pay a penny more
than the runner-up bid. (Example: If Joe bids 10 cents a click, Alice bids 6, and
Sue bids 2, Joe wins the top slot and pays 7. Alice is in the next slot, paying 3.)
It was incredibly liberating because it eliminated the fear of “winner’s remorse,”
where the high bidder in an auction feels suckered by paying too much. In the
Google model, no one would feel like an idiot for paying a dollar a click when
the competitor below them bought a slot on the same page, positioned just a few
pixels lower than their ad, for only 10 cents a click. In that case, a winner would
get the prime position for 11 cents.
Veach knew in his heart this was the right way to go, but he had to do a lot
of explaining. “Larry and Sergey kept asking me if it wasn’t simpler to have an
auction where we just have people pay what they bid,” he says. “And I kept
saying, ‘No,’ because then people have this incentive to keep lowering their
bids.”
To run its ad operation, Google had hired Sheryl Sandberg, former chief of
staff to the secretary of the treasury in the Clinton administration. She’d gotten
to know Eric Schmidt when he visited D.C. to argue against Internet taxes.
Though she’d never been involved in high tech—besides her Treasury post, her
résumé included McKinsey & Company and the World Bank—she’d spent the
past few years observing what was happening in Silicon Valley. Part of her job at
Google was explaining its innovative auction. She kept staring at the formula,
wondering why it seemed so familiar. So she called her former boss, Treasury
Secretary Larry Summers.
“Larry, we have this problem,” she said. “I’m trying to explain how our
auction works—it seems familiar to me.” She described it to him.
“Oh yeah,” said Summers. “That’s a Vickery second-bid auction!” He
explained that not only was this a technique used by the government to sell (Source: data/pdf/In The Plex (Google).pdfPage: 99)
Federal Reserve bonds but the economist who had devised it had won a Nobel
Prize.
Veach had reinvented it from scratch.
One fan of Veach’s system was the top auction theorist, Stanford economist
Paul Milgrom. “Overture’s auctions were much less successful,” says Milgrom.
“In that world, you bid by the slot. If you wanted to be in third position, you put
in a bid for third. If there’s an obvious guy to win the first position, nobody
would bid against him, and he’d get it cheap. If you wanted to be in every
position, you had to make bids for each of them. But Google simplified the
auction. Instead of making eight bids for the eight positions, you made one
single bid. The competition for second position will automatically raise the price
for the first position. So the simplification thickens the market. The effect is that
it guarantees that there’s competition for the top positions.”
Veach and Kamangar’s implementation was so impressive that it changed
even Milgrom’s way of thinking. “Once I saw this from Google, I began seeing
it everywhere,” he says, citing examples in spectrum auctions, diamond markets,
and the competition between Kenyan and Rwandan coffee beans. “I’ve begun to
realize that Google somehow or other introduced a level of simplification to ad
auctions that was not included before.” And it wasn’t just a theoretical advance.
“Google immediately started getting higher prices for advertising than Overture
was getting,” he notes.
That wasn’t only because of the auction model; Veach and Kamangar had
made other significant advances. One of the biggest was the adoption of the
other Overture idea, pay per click. Google’s improved version of the original
AdWords, called AdWords Select, would no longer charge per impression,
according to how many people saw an ad. Instead, the click-through rate would
become the measure of online advertising. The bids advertisers submitted would
specify how much they were willing to pay each time a user clicked on the ad
and was sent to the landing page on the advertiser’s website.
The longtime joke in the marketing world was that only half of advertising
is worth the money—but no one can tell which half. Google was switching the
game: using its system, you would pay for ads only when they worked.
That was not all. The ad model that Veach and Kamanger created had yet
another major innovation, but this one was exclusively Google’s. It would
become the least understood, most controversial, and ultimately most powerful
component of AdWords Select: a built-in function to regulate ad quality. The
new system instituted financial incentives for better ads. It lowered the price for
effective ads and meted out monetary punishment and even an online ad version
of the death penalty for bad ads. It also opened Google to the charge that it had (Source: data/pdf/In The Plex (Google).pdfPage: 100)
created a “black box” in which advertisers could never understand, or trust, the
calculations that Google made to place their ads.
Here was the rub: The bids submitted by contenders for the ad slots were
only half of what ultimately determined the winners of the auction. The other
half was the quality score. This metric would assure that the ads Google showed

Veach would acknowledge this. “It’s not so much that any of these ideas on
their own are complicated,” he says. “But when you put the three together, you (Source: data/pdf/In The Plex (Google).pdfPage: 101)
The policy reflected the different philosophy Google brought to advertising
in general. Google ads were answers. They were solutions. “Ideally we wanted
people to have a 50 to 100 percent click rate,” says Armstrong.
Jeff Levick, whose job it was to gin up ads from companies servicing other
businesses (B2B), would cold-call prospective advertisers. They would say,
“What’s Google?” He would tell them about the searches conducted in Google
and what keywords were already performing for advertisers. One sector ripe for
this pitch was the box business—boxes for shipping, boxes stuffed with Bubble
Wrap. So he called a company called Uline, which, like Levick, was based in
Chicago. “Do you know that in the last twenty-four hours 1,500 people typed the
word ‘boxes’ into the Google search engine?” he said to the guy in purchasing
whom he finally managed to reach. “Would you like those people to come to
your website?” Levick wound up doing a lot of business in boxes.
With Premium Sunset the algorithm was displacing the handshake. The
system itself would police ad quality by estimating the success of an ad and
incorporating that into the bid price. And the sales force would have different
kinds of interactions with clients. The old job was making a sale. Their new job
would be … getting the big companies they dealt with to place bids in an
auction? “We thought it was a little half cocked,” says Jeff Levick. “If we let the
auction set prices, we worried that we could actually lose a lot of money.”
But the die was cast. Tim Armstrong, the executive in the New York office
in charge of sales, gave his people an upbeat description of the system. Schmidt
came to New York to assure them that it was the right move. “People were
extremely upset, because this was a material change in the way they were doing
business,” Schmidt would later recall. Ultimately, since the engineers in
Mountain View had made good on their promises so far, the salespeople trusted
them on this one. They weren’t going to be replaced. They were going to assume
a new role as mediators between advertisers and algorithms.
“Our group’s job was to build the largest bridge we could between Silicon
Valley and Madison Avenue,” says Armstrong. “It was really bringing science to
the art of advertising and being able to scale the art of advertising through
science.”
For Jeff Levick the big test came in his favorite product category—the
boxes. Box firms had become some of the biggest advertisers at Google, and he
spent a lot of time on the road seeing them, one in Southern California, one in
Boston, and one nearby in Chicago. All were seeing an excellent return in their
investments in Premium. Now Levick would explain that Google was pulling the
plug on Premium and they were now going to have to participate in a high-stakes
version of eBay. “The guy in California literally almost threw us out of his office (Source: data/pdf/In The Plex (Google).pdfPage: 121)
can’t easily explain it to advertisers.” On the other hand, he adds, “It actually
turns into a fun mathematical problem, which I loved.”
From the start, Page and Brin had an idealistic view that Google would run
ads only if users deemed them a useful feature. Using mathematical wizardry,
Veach and Kamangar had come up with a mechanism to realize that fantastic

But would it work? For one thing, executing the system was a huge
technological challenge. Every AdWords Select ad would be the winner of a
unique auction requiring the execution of a complicated formula. The auction
would be conducted in stealth, generated the instant someone typed a keyword

the old CPM system and sent all its advertisers an email informing them of the (Source: data/pdf/In The Plex (Google).pdfPage: 102)
long tail is the term used to refer to smaller, geographically disparate businesses
and interests. The Internet—particularly with the help of a search engine like
Google—made long-tail enterprises easy to reach.) If you made the system self-
service, you could handle thousands of small advertisers, and the overhead
would be so low that customers could buy ads very cheaply. So in October 2000
Google launched a product catering to smaller operations that had not previously
contemplated an online buy. (Armstrong’s team kept selling premium sponsored
links to big advertisers.)
Google named the self-service system “AdWords.” It was a do-it-yourself
marketplace for keywords, purchased by credit card. When someone came to
Google and searched using one of those keywords, a few words of text with a
link to the advertiser’s home page would appear. The ad would be very similar to
a search result, only paid for. Those ads ran to the right of the search results, as
suggested by an adviser to Google, the Israeli high-tech investor Yossi Vardi. If
you drew a vertical line two-thirds of the way across the page and put text ads to
the right, he told Brin one day, it would be clear which were the real algorithm-
discovered search results—known as “organic” results—and which were paid
links. Google also made sure to label the ads “sponsored links” to further
distinguish them from the purity of its organic search results.
AdWords prices were fixed according to the position on the page an ad
would occupy. If it was in the most desirable position, the top ad on the right, the
client would pay $15 per thousand exposures. The second position cost $12, the
third $10. There was one feature built in to try to ensure that the most useful ads
would appear: advertisers couldn’t pay their way to secure the best positions.
Instead, the more successful ones—the ones that lured the most people to click
on them and go to the advertiser’s landing page—would get priority. The
percentage of people exposed to ads who responded to them became known as
the click-through rate.
This was Google’s first stab at what became known as ad quality. It would
become a vital component of the company’s strategy, which viewed the ad
system as a virtuous triangle with three happy parties: Google, the advertiser,
and especially the user. Unwanted ads made unhappy customers, so Google
made it a high priority to calibrate the system to drive out ads that were
irrelevant or annoying.
One day in October 2000 the engineers who coded the system tested
AdWords with a little text ad of their own that read, “Have a credit card and 5
minutes? Get your ad on Google today.” It was shown to only a small number of
users. Within minutes, someone had clicked on it and began filling out the form.
And barely a half an hour after that, someone who typed in the words “Live (Source: data/pdf/In The Plex (Google).pdfPage: 95)

要点如下：
- 广告排名不仅取决于出价，还由一个质量分数（quality score）等“隐藏”因素共同决定。出价只是“半数”影响因素，另一半来自内部的质量评估（包括对广告相关性、着陆页质量、潜在点击率等的预测）。这使得广告主很难理解为什么某些广告会获得特定位置或价格。（Source: data/pdf/In The Plex (Google).pdfPage: 99-101）
