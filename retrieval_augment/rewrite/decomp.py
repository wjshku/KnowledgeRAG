# Query Decomposition for Retrieval Augmentation

class QueryDecomposition:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def decompose(self, query: str):
        # Decompose the query into sub-queries
        #
        # Benefits:
        # 1. Recall gaps:
        #    - Single queries can miss documents
        #    - Sub-queries widen coverage
        #
        # 2. Ambiguity:
        #    - Makes implicit criteria explicit and testable
        #
        # 3. Ranking noise:
        #    - Filter-then-rank on sub-results yields cleaner final sets
        #
        # 4. Compositional reasoning:
        #    - Supports stepwise filtering
        #    - Enables intersections
        #    - Allows trade-off analysis
