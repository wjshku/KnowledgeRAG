# Coreference Resolution for Retrieval Augmentation

class CoreferenceResolution:
    def __init__(self):
        pass

    def resolve(self, query: str, context: str):
        # Resolve the coreference in the query
        #
        # Benefits:
        # 1. Clarity:
        #    - Makes implicit criteria explicit and testable
        #
        # 2. Ranking noise:
        #    - Filter-then-rank on sub-results yields cleaner final sets
        #
        # 3. Compositional reasoning:
        #    - Supports stepwise filtering
        #    - Enables intersections
        #    - Allows trade-off analysis
